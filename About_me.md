# Parichard Traphichiensuk - Portfolio

## About 

Hello, I am Parichard Traiphichiensuk, but you may call me Toon. I recently graduated with a degree in Library and Information Science from Thammasat University.

During my studies, I acquired skills in database management, information retrieval, and data visualization. Although my current role does not involve direct data handling, 
I apply my knowledge effectively in my position. For instance, I am responsible for preparing monthly reports on policy renewals and gathering various pieces of information 
to assess potential risks and determine eligibility for insurance coverage.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. 
Through my work and extracurricular activities, I have gained valuable experience in data analysis, time management, teamwork, and communication.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics
